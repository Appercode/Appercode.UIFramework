# UI Framework
Appercode UI Framework brings Windows Phone UI Object Model to iOS and Android.

Appercode contains more than 30 controls ported from Windows Phone starting from TextBlock and Button to Grid and WebBrowser. Apart from them the platform provides some additional cross-platform controls such as Fly-out menu and Tabs control. On top of that developers can create their own controls and enlarge the platform.

Appercode was created to reduce the entry level requirements for new developers familiar with Windows Phone. Therefore, by using it you get the tools, very similar to those in Windows Phone. To create cross-platform applications you do not have to learn iOS or Android.
